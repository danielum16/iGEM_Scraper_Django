Cas9 is an RNA guided endonuclease that is revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and is now being applied to therapeutics for the site-specific modification of the genome.  One of the major challenges facing CRISPR-Cas9 technology is efficient intracellular delivery and nuclear localization.  To this end, we are producing a fusion protein of the NLS-tagged Cas9 endonuclease and an atoxic variant of the Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB). The TcdB protein mediates cell penetration by binding extracellular epitopes, entering via endocytosis, and delivering the active toxin component through the endosome membrane. By expressing the Cas9 protein at the N-terminus, and knocking out the toxin\u2019s active site residues, the pore-forming component of the aTcdB protein should facilitate intracellular delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing platform.\n", "team": "Tufts", "title": "Toxin Delivery of Cas9 to Mammalian Cells"},

Having different types, each type of cancer has its own characteristics on molecular level. Different molecules are produced by cancer cells such as proteins, and secondary metabolites. Because of their specificity, they have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis over past decades. Recently, volatile organic compounds have been identified as biomarker to discriminate the types of cancer. In this project, we plan to construct bacterial whole-cell biosensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose cancer. Different VOCs will be sensed by different promoter/transcription factor couples, and they will be incorporated into circuits and logic gates operated by CRISPRi system in order to differentiate cancer types effectively based on existence of specific VOCs.\n", "team": "Bilkent-UNAMBG", "title": "Smelling Cancer - A VOC-Based Biosensor for Cancer Diagnosis"},

Such proteins could be utilized for target-mediated drug delivery and in diagnostics, especially for the detection of quickly evolving pathogens such as viruses.

Afterwards, we use a special DNA-Polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. This selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure. Therefore, the desired clones are enriched in the fermentation broth and can be identified easily.\r\n\n", "team": "Bielefeld-CeBiTec", "title": "Evobodies - Molecular Speed Dating"},

This study\u2019s aim is to understand and manipulate this community to imbue kombucha with favorable properties for producers and consumers. One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha\u2019s microbial community undergoes.\n", "team": "Austin_UTexas", "title": "The Bucha Bunch"},

PET is one of the most common plastic polymers, comprised of repeating monomeric subunits of Terephthalic Acid and Ethylene Glycol.

As avid users of PET-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of PET, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. We were further inspired to pursue this goal with Keio University\u2019s recent discovery of Ideonella sakaiensis \u2014 a unique bacteria capable of PET degradation. Thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal PETase biobrick, which would be included in the iGEM database.

Bioengineers have incorporated QS networks into genetic circuits, using HSLs to connect logical operations. However, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by \u201ccrosstalk,\u201d in which one QS network responds to HSLs produced by another network. In addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple QS networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. Using a system that decouples \u201cSenders\u201d from \u201cReceivers,\u201d we are exploring how QS networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. Our project adds 21 new plasmids for QS-based communication, including 12 novel QS proteins, to the iGEM Registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with HSLs, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits. \n", "team": "Arizona_State", "title": "Ringtones: Diverse homoserine lactone systems for cellular communication"},
{"url": "http://igem.org/Team.cgi?team_id=2145", "abstract": "Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or  DNA \"clamps\" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. If DNA clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units, then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry.\n", "team": "Alverno_CA", "title": "Strategies for blocking propagation of supercoiling generated during transcription"},

Exposure to MCs is linked to higher levels of oxidative stress, and we will couple this response to the expression of yellow fluorescent protein. Thus, fluorescence levels will indicate the amount of MCs present in a sample. To understand and validate our MC detection mechanism, we will also create mathematical and molecular models.
